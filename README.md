We have stopped capturing testing data at a district level. Please check the status of the API endpoints below.

## CSV

Sometimes, having files in a spreadsheet format is more useful for analysts and scientists. We have provided the files as downloadable csv files as below.

### Files available

Latest data from the google sheet (10-20 minutes delayed) is available through the `latest` end-point.
These are the files available

#### Note

- Use raw data files only if you need to analyze the demographics or notes related at a patient level
- Always try to use the aggregated numbers above as they have been treated for discrepancies

#### How to

If you prefer working on a Google Sheet instead of downloading the files and would like the data to reflect the latest version - below is an example to live fetch this CSV to a spreadsheet.
> :rocket: Quick example : Apply the formula `=IMPORTDATA("https://api.covid19india.org/csv/latest/state_wise.csv")` in A1 cell of a Google Sheets to get the state data for analysis :)

## How this works

- Data in this repository is generated from Google Sheets
- Volunteers collect data from trusted sources and update the sheet
- Github Actions periodically fetch the data from the sheet and upload static json and csv files into `gh-pages` branch of this repo
- `gh-pages` serves the json/csv files at <https://api.covid19india.org>

## License

This repository contains both the code that routinely fetches the data from Google Sheet and convert it into JSON files in the required format and the data itself (in the gh-pages branch). So, the content of this repository is licensed in two ways : Code and Data

License for Code (Consider this as everything in the `master` branch) : MIT License (Detailed in LICENSE_CODE.txt)  
License for Data (Consider this as everything in the `gh-pages` branch) : CC-BY-4.0 License (Detailed in LICENSE_DATA.txt)
